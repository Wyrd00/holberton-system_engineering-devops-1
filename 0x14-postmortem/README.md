# 0x11. Postmortem

### Issue Summary
From 4:45 PM to 5:28 PM PST, Nginx failed to restart on both servers `web-01` and `web-02`, resulting in 500 response messages returned. The domain, `holbertonschool.online` was inaccessbile to user(s), affecting 100% of the traffic. The root cause of this outage was an invalid syntax on the nginx confirguration file, causing nginx to fail to restart properly. 

### Timeline (All Pacific Standard Time)
- **4:45 PM:** Configuration changes made and pushed to implement a new user, Nginx
- **4:50 PM:** Outage begins when the Engineer notices the servers failed to restart
- **4:55 PM:** Engineer stops `web-01` and rollsback to the backup configuration file
- **4:56 PM:** Engineer run a nginx script to detect if the is issue were changes made to the configuration file
- **4:57 PM:** Nginx script returns an error stating the configuration fileâ€™s syntax is incorrect
- **5:02 PM:** Engineer re-implements changes made to the default file.
- **5:15 PM:** Syntax was corrected, and nginx script ran again to recheck syntax errors. No erros returned.
- **5:17 PM:** Engineer re-implements changes and deems it unecessary to escalate issue
- **5:20 PM:** `web-01` restarts successfully and Engineer reimplements changes to server web-02
- **5:28 PM:** Both servers are back up and 100% of traffic is back online

Root Cause
At 4:33 PM PST, changes were made to add a new user, Nginx, into the configuration fle, nginx.conf along with changing the listening port from 80 to 8080. Changes were tested locally to ensure sytax was correct, but they were not tested on the configuration file nor the default file itself. At 4:50 PM, the Engineer notices the servers were unable to restart when the configuration changes where made. When adding a new user, the Engineer missed a semi-colon to close the line and did not run the nginx -t script to check if the syntax was correct before implementing new changes. Changes were implemented, causing the servers undable to restart properly. 

Since only two files were changed, at 4:56 PM the Engineer ran service nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -t to check if the root cause stemed from changes made to the nginx.conf file. An error was returned stating the syntax was not correct, which cause the server to fail restart. The engineer checks the syntax and finds a missing semi-colon upon creating the new user, Nginx - the semi-colon was added and changes reimplemented. At 5:28 PM, Web-01 started succesfully and changes were then made to web-02. 

Corrective and Preventative Measures

After a day of internal review and analysis, the following preventative measures were made. 
After local testing, testing should be made on the files itself before implementation via script. 
When changes made via the nginx.conf file, the engineer should run the nginx script ( service nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf -t ) to check if there were any syntax issues.
